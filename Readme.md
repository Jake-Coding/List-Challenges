# List_Challenges

## Explanation of Files

In this repo there are 2 files
1. list_challenges.rb
2. smol_challenge.rb

list_challenges is the list_challenges assignment
smol_challenge is my attempt to make the code run in as few lines as possible, regardless of complexity

## How to run

1. Open the files in a code editor and un-comment the lines that you want to run
2. Type `ruby filename.rb` into the console
